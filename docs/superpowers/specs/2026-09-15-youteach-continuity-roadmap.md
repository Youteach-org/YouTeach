# YouTeach continuity roadmap

Date: 2026-09-15
Repository: youteachtk/YouTeach
Status: active
Production target: Cloudflare Pages

## 1. Continuity / decision rule

From this point forward, material product decisions, architecture decisions, workflow rules, and accepted UX behavior for YouTeach must be written to GitHub so another ChatGPT instance can continue without depending on chat memory.

Canonical location:
- `docs/superpowers/specs/`

Working rule:
1. GitHub is the source of truth.
2. Implement code in GitHub first.
3. Cloudflare deploys from GitHub.
4. Update this roadmap or a dated spec whenever a material decision changes.
5. Do not rely on Vercel as the production source of truth.
6. Keep YouTeach separate from Classroom Online Games repositories; integrations use explicit contracts only.

## 2. Current architecture

- Frontend: static HTML/CSS/JS from `youteachtk/YouTeach`.
- Production hosting: Cloudflare Pages.
- Database / live state: Firebase Realtime Database.
- Assignment evidence storage: Google Drive.
- Assignment PDFs are not stored in Firebase Storage.
- Assignment upload route: Cloudflare Pages Function at `/api/drive-upload-session`.
- AI grade import route: Cloudflare Pages Function at `/api/sync-ai-grades`.

## 3. Assignment decisions already accepted

### 3.1 Task identity
- Task Code is generated automatically.
- Task type provides the prefix, e.g. CT, HW, EX, PJ, PC, RS, PT.
- Group contributes a compact group key.
- Date uses DDMMYY.
- If generated code already exists, the teacher must change task-defining data.
- Before submissions exist, task-defining data may update the code.
- After the first submission exists, task-defining data and Task Code are locked.

### 3.2 Student submissions
- PDF only.
- Maximum 15 MB.
- One current PDF per student per task.
- Re-submission replaces the previous PDF.
- Undo Submission deletes the previous Drive file/evidence and allows a new submission.
- Each task uses its own Drive folder:
  `YouTeach Assignments/{TASK-CODE}/`
- Student PDF naming is based on student identity + Task Code.
- Identity is never assumed from filename alone; visible/written identity inside the PDF is checked during grading.

### 3.3 Evaluation criteria
- Every assignment rubric totals 100 points.
- Criteria can be:
  - preset;
  - custom.
- Points may be distributed equally or manually.
- Teacher-only grading notes are supported.
- Current accepted preset examples include Neatness, Originality, Analysis, Conclusions, Complete Work, and other teacher-selected criteria.
- A criterion that cannot be evaluated from available evidence must not automatically receive zero.

### 3.4 Grading
Two grading paths coexist:

#### Manual grading
- Teacher grades from the submitted-student card.
- Scores are entered per criterion.
- Total is calculated out of 100.
- Teacher feedback is stored with the submission.

#### AI grading
- AI Grading opens ChatGPT for the selected Task Code.
- ChatGPT reads the task rubric JSON and submitted PDFs from the task Drive folder.
- ChatGPT evaluates the exact configured criteria.
- Identity is marked verified, manual-review, or mismatch.
- Non-evaluable criteria use `not-gradable` and `score: null`; no invented score.
- ChatGPT creates/replaces:
  `{TASK-CODE}--grading-results.json`
- YouTeach imports that file with Sync AI Grades.

Conflict modes:
- Keep Manual
- Replace with AI
- Compare

A manual grade must never be silently overwritten by AI.

### 3.5 Grading order / visual states
- Ungraded student submissions appear first.
- Graded student submissions use a distinct visual state and move to the end.
- If AI reviewed a submission but a criterion still requires manual review, it remains in the pending section.
- Fully evaluated assignments can also use a distinct state and move later in the assignment browser; this behavior is retained.

## 4. Accepted Teacher Assignments UX

- Assignment cards are compact, not full-page rows.
- Desktop aims to show multiple assignment cards at once.
- Assignment browser supports compact filtering/navigation.
- Create Assignment is hidden until requested from Actions.
- Selected assignment summary is compact.
- Criteria summary is compact and visible when an assignment is selected.
- Criteria are arranged efficiently rather than occupying large vertical panels.
- Manual grading opens from a student submission card.
- Missing submissions remain secondary/collapsible.
- Student submission cards are the primary content.
- Avoid wasting vertical space.
- Hamburger menu must reserve a safe zone so it never covers page titles.

## 5. Accepted Student Assignments UX

- Compact card grid.
- Desktop target: six assignment cards per row where viewport allows.
- Responsive fallback for tablet/mobile.
- Clear submission state.
- After successful upload, normal Submit is disabled.
- Undo Submission is available.
- After undo, next action is Submit Again.
- Status text must be visibly distinguishable.

## 6. Login / responsive decisions

- Teacher and Student password fields include a show/hide password control.
- Tablet portrait layouts must use the available screen width.
- Hidden sidebar must not reserve a phantom desktop column.
- Teacher Home tablet portrait uses a responsive multi-column layout instead of narrow vertical strips.
- Mobile may collapse to one column where appropriate.

## 7. Immediate next milestone: close the grading loop end-to-end

Priority 1.

Test with real existing assignment submissions:

1. Select a task with submitted PDFs.
2. Run AI Grading.
3. Confirm ChatGPT reads:
   - `{TASK-CODE}--evaluation-criteria.json`
   - every submitted PDF in that folder.
4. Confirm ChatGPT writes:
   - `{TASK-CODE}--grading-results.json`
5. Run Sync AI Grades in YouTeach.
6. Verify Firebase receives:
   - criterion scores;
   - total /100 when calculable;
   - feedback;
   - identity status;
   - AI/manual mode;
   - manual-review state for non-gradable criteria.
7. Verify student submission cards:
   - pending first;
   - graded last;
   - distinct graded color;
   - correct displayed total.
8. Test all three conflict modes:
   - Keep Manual;
   - Replace with AI;
   - Compare.
9. Confirm no PDF, rubric, or manual grade is deleted unintentionally.

Acceptance: one complete real task can be graded from ChatGPT and synchronized back into YouTeach without copying grades manually.

## 8. Next milestone: cross-device UI validation

Priority 2.

Validate:
- desktop;
- tablet landscape;
- tablet portrait;
- phone portrait.

Pages:
- Teacher Home
- Teacher Assignments
- Student Assignments
- Teacher Login
- Student Login
- Buzzer / Student Buzzer

Acceptance:
- no narrow phantom columns;
- no title/hamburger overlap;
- no clipped controls;
- no word-by-word vertical wrapping;
- cards use available width;
- secondary controls do not dominate primary content.

## 9. Next milestone: grading results for students

Priority 3, after teacher-side grading is verified.

Planned behavior:
- Student can see grade /100 when released.
- Student can see criterion breakdown and teacher/AI feedback.
- Identity/manual-review warnings are teacher-side unless a deliberate student-facing message is defined.
- Teacher controls release/publication of grades.

This milestone still needs explicit UX decisions before implementation.

## 10. Next milestone: assignment lifecycle

Priority 4.

Remaining decisions / implementation:
- archive old assignments;
- reopen vs permanently close;
- whether closed tasks accept teacher-authorized late submission;
- grade release status;
- optional due-date exception per student;
- grading history / audit trail if a grade changes.

Do not implement these without confirming the desired behavior.

## 11. Next milestone: authentication hardening

Priority 5.

Current teacher login still contains simple built-in credentials. Before wider real-world deployment, replace this with a proper authentication/authorization model while preserving teacher/admin roles.

Requirements to decide:
- Firebase Auth vs another provider;
- teacher account provisioning;
- password reset;
- admin account management;
- session duration;
- permission model.

## 12. Cloudflare / deployment cleanup

After the Cloudflare production path is confirmed stable:
- remove obsolete Vercel-only deployment assumptions;
- keep only compatibility files that still serve a documented purpose;
- document required Cloudflare secrets;
- verify no hard-coded production links still point to Vercel;
- keep GitHub -> Cloudflare as the canonical deployment path.

## 13. COG / Verb Runner integration boundary

YouTeach remains the source of student identity/credentials/session context.
Classroom Online Games remains a separate repository.

Continue integration through explicit launch/session contracts rather than merging repositories.

Pending follow-up:
- validate credentialed Verb Runner launch end-to-end;
- verify Teacher Monitor sees free-mode students as well as session students;
- preserve nickname/identity uniqueness.

## 14. Current next action

Do not add another large feature first.

Next action is:
**run and fix the complete AI grading round-trip on one real task until it works end-to-end.**

After that:
1. cross-device UI verification;
2. student-visible grade release design;
3. assignment lifecycle;
4. authentication hardening;
5. deployment cleanup.
